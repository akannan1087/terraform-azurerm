# Release Log

## Version 0.1.5 and Before

These were releases that were used in the conversion from individual
module versioning, to versioning the library as a whole.  Version v0.1.0 
has the original versioning, if you want to look as a specific older
version of a module.

## Version 0.1.6

The first vesion released with the new tagging structure.  All modules
are reset to version v1 (and will probably stay there).  We consider 
this the be the start of the project and this we where we started
annoucing this project to the public.
